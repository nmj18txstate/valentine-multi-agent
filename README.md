# 💝 Valentine Copilot (Multi-Agent Streamlit App) 
Design Philosophy: This project demonstrates role-specialized prompt orchestration rather than tool-based agents. 
Each agent operates with a clearly scoped behavioral contract and isolated system prompt.
A lightweight multi-agent AI application built with **Streamlit + OpenAI**, designed to generate:
- 🎶 Romantic lyrics & heartfelt love notes  
- 🌿 Trauma-aware ADHD-friendly Valentine plans  
- 🤝 Partner support scripts and relationship guidance  

This project demonstrates a simple **multi-agent orchestration pattern** using specialized AI roles.
